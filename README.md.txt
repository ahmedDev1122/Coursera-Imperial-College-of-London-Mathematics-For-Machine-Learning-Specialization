# Mathematics for Machine Learning
**Institution:** Imperial College London

## Specialization Overview
This specialization is designed to give learners the mathematical foundation required to understand and implement machine learning algorithms. It includes three core modules:

1. **Linear Algebra** – vectors, matrices, transformations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.  
2. **Multivariate Calculus** – derivatives, gradients, partial derivatives, and the chain rule.  
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

## Repository Contents
Each module folder contains:
- PDFs of lectures  
- Exercise sheets  
- Screenshots of solved exercises

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to consolidate all study materials in an organized and accessible way, providing a clear reference for learning mathematics essential for machine learning.
