Imperial College London – Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains solutions to the assignments of the Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization from Imperial College London on Coursera, taught by David Dye, Samuel J. Cooper, A. Freddie Page, and Marc Peter Deisenroth.

About This Specialization

Many advanced Machine Learning and Data Science courses require a solid foundation in mathematics. This specialization bridges that gap, refreshing key mathematical concepts and connecting them to real-world Machine Learning applications.

It includes three courses:

Linear Algebra – Understanding vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, with practical applications in Python.

Multivariate Calculus – Building tools for optimization, gradients, and function approximation applied to neural networks and regression.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Dimensionality reduction, orthogonal projections, and applying PCA to real datasets.

What You Will Learn

Implement mathematical concepts using Python and real-world data

Derive and apply PCA from a projection perspective

Understand orthogonal projections and their applications

Build a strong mathematical foundation for advanced Machine Learning

Applied Learning Projects

Through the assignments, you will create mini-projects using Python and Jupyter notebooks, applying the concepts learned to practical problems. Examples include:

Using linear algebra to calculate PageRank

Applying multivariate calculus to train neural networks

Performing non-linear regression to fit datasets

Using PCA for feature extraction from the MNIST dataset
